              🤖 What Is Smart Learning AI? Smart Learning AI is an intelligent
              learning system that uses artificial intelligence techniques to
              personalize and improve the learning experience for each user.
              Unlike traditional learning platforms that provide the same
              content to everyone, Smart Learning AI analyzes user data such as
              learning goals, progress, performance, and behavior to deliver
              customized learning paths and recommendations.
