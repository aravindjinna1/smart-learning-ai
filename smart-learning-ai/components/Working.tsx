        🤖 What Is Smart Learning AI? Smart Learning AI is an intelligent
        learning system that uses artificial intelligence techniques to
        personalize and improve the learning experience for each user. Unlike
        traditional learning platforms that provide the same content to
        everyone, Smart Learning AI analyzes user data such as learning goals,
        progress, performance, and behavior to deliver customized learning
        paths and recommendations.
